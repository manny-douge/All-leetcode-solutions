# What is this repo?

In hopes of building a long term habit of learning and maintaining 
skills related to technical problems and time/space complexity analysis.
This repository serves a habit-tracking repo for my
daily practice on LeetCode and related technical problems.


At the start of this repo, there were 1700 problems on LeetCode,
so that will be the ending point of this repository unless any
new developments encourage me to continue.
